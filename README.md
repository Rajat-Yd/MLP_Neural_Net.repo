# MLP_Neural_Net.repo :
 - This Colab-NoteBook show how to build a multilayer and Multi perceptron neural network. Using Keras library.
# What is MLP ? :
- A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. 
- The neurons in the MLP typically use nonlinear activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data.
- The major use cases of MLP are pattern classification, recognition, prediction and approximation.
